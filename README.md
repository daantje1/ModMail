# ModMail
Simple ModMail Discord Bot! Written in javascript!

To use the bot is very simple. Simply clone the repository, and add in what your Discord ID is, your discord server you are going to accept modmail in (should be private), and what category you want the tickets to go into in said server.

If there are any problems feel free to DM me, or join my discord at discord.gg/VTNECKV


Modules needed:
